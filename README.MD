# Assisted Progression
Over the years and across various mods, there are ideas for blocks and items that don't fit some overall theme, but are still nice to have. This mod is a repository of sorts for those ideas. While every idea may not be completly novel, there are plenty of simple to use items and blocks that assist along the way in modded minecraft.
